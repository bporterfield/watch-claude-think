**watch-claude-think** is an interactive CLI - like Claude Code - that monitors your Claude Code sessions and displays both `claude`'s internal reasoning process and user messages in real-time. Watch as Claude Code thinks through problems, plans solutions, and makes decisions.

## Quick Start

**TL;DR**: Turn thinking on (`Tab` to toggle in `claude`) and then run `npx watch-claude-think` and you're in the brain.

Or with other package managers:

- pnpm: `pnpm dlx watch-claude-think`
- yarn: `yarn dlx watch-claude-think`
- bun: `bunx watch-claude-think`

## Why

Watching Claude Code think is fun, and quite useful!

- You can often catch it making silly assumptions about things and interject before it goes off the rails
- Watching it work through problems also often provides some inspiration or additional ideas about architecure, dependencies, etc.
- It's also a great way to learn how to improve your prompting - it will be quite obvious when Claude has the context it needs and when it does not.
- Claude will also often think things that it does not output, and often those things are worth knowing

Also, sometimes it's a riot:

> "4:02:16 PM Claude: I have lint errors. Let me fix them:
>
> 1.  `currentFilePaths` should be `const` - but actually we do reassign it in the index operation. The linter is wrong here, but I'll change the logic to avoid the mutation

You can `ctrl-o` in Claude Code sometimes to see thinking, but the experience (and especially the experience across `claude` instances) is not the same - it goes away, it's obscured by other tool calls or messages, and it's not across all agents.

## Installation

### Option 1: Run now

- **npm**: `npx watch-claude-think`
- **pnpm**: `pnpm dlx watch-claude-think`
- **yarn**: `yarn dlx watch-claude-think`
- **bun**: `bunx watch-claude-think`

### Option 2: Install Globally

If you want the `watch-claude-think` command available everywhere:

```bash
npm install -g watch-claude-think
# or
pnpm add -g watch-claude-think
# or
yarn global add watch-claude-think
# or
bun add -g watch-claude-think
```

then run `watch-claude-think`

## Usage

### Step 1: Enable Thinking Mode in Claude Code

Press `Tab` in Claude Code to cycle thinking mode **ON** (it must show extended thinking)

### Step 2: Start Watching

Run `npx watch-claude-think` (or `watch-claude-think` if installed globally)

### Step 3: Select What to Watch

1. Pick your project (or a project's worktree) from the list
2. Choose either:
   - **Watch All Sessions** - see all Claude activity in this project
   - **Watch Specific Session** - focus on one conversation

**Note**: Session names may not exactly map to Claude Code `/resume` session names, but usually you can figure it out (or just watch All Sessions in a project)

## ClaudeSmells

Some things that might make you want to jump in to wrangle `claude`:

- "But these tests aren't related to my changes and were already failing" - you sure about that??
- "Let me mock..." - sometimes mocking is fine, `claude` over-uses instead of solving problems
- Mucking with project config unless you specifically asked (i.e. `tsconfig.json`)- this often ends badly
- "Let me try a simpler approach" - often at the expense of correctness or fully understanding a problem
- "**FOUND IT!**" - `claude` probably did not find it
- "Now I need to update the other two components that also use"... keep it DRY probably
- "Actually" count - if `claude` is saying "actually" a bunch of times in a row while thinking, it's just spinning and you should probably give it direction. It will probably do something silly soon. Here's a really fun one - after I asked `claude` to fix an issue with the footer (I still want the footer!) and about 22 "Actually..." statements, we get "Actually, you know what, let me try the simplest possible thing: just don't render a footer at all for now. Keep the keyboard shortcuts working, but don't show the persistent footer UI. This eliminates the problem entirely." ü§†

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Active Claude Code sessions** `watch-claude-think` reads from `~/.claude/projects`
