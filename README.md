`watch-claude-think` is an interactive CLI that monitors and displays Claude's internal reasoning across all your `claude` sessions in a folder.

<img width="1135" height="384" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-10 at 3 51 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/530ea39f-45db-4756-b5e2-b894d0323a63" />


`watch-claude-think` doesn't use tokens or make web requests - it just monitors your `~/.claude` folder and displays thinking updates.

## Quick Start

Enable thinking mode in Claude Code (press `Tab`) and run:

```bash
npx watch-claude-think
```

Or with other package managers:

- **pnpm**: `pnpm dlx watch-claude-think`
- **yarn**: `yarn dlx watch-claude-think`
- **bun**: `bunx watch-claude-think`

## Why

Watching Claude Code think is fun, and actually has been pretty useful:

- It's an easy way to catch silly assumptions and interject before Claude spins its wheels on the wrong thing
- Claude's thoughts can hint at alternative approaches, architecture choices, or dependencies
- It's a great way to improve prompting - you'll see quickly when Claude has the context it needs cleary does not
- Claude often thinkgs things that it does not output, and some of those things are quite useful to read

Also, sometimes it's a riot:

> "4:02:16 PM Claude: I have lint errors. Let me fix them:
>
> 1.  `currentFilePaths` should be `const` - but actually we do reassign it in the index operation. The linter is wrong here, but I'll change the logic to avoid the mutation

`ctrl-o` in Claude Code shows thinking briefly, but the view disappears, gets obscured by other messages, and doesn't persist across agents.

## Installation

### Run Directly

Use `npx` (or equivalent) as shown in Quick Start.

### Install Globally

```bash
npm install -g watch-claude-think
# or
pnpm add -g watch-claude-think
# or
yarn global add watch-claude-think
# or
bun add -g watch-claude-think
```

Then run `watch-claude-think` from anywhere.

## Usage

### 1. Enable Thinking Mode

Press `Tab` in Claude Code to toggle thinking mode **ON**.

### 2. Start Watching

Run `npx watch-claude-think` (or `watch-claude-think` if installed globally).

### 3. Select What to Watch

1. Pick your folder/proejct (or worktree) from the list
2. Choose either:
   - **Watch All Sessions** - see all Claude activity in this project
   - **Watch Specific Session** - focus on one conversation

Session names may not match Claude Code `/resume` names exactly...when in doubt, watch All Sessions.

## ClaudeSmells

Signs you should intervene:

- "But these tests aren't related to my changes and were already failing" - are you sure?
- "Let me mock..." - Claude over-mocks instead of solving problems
- Modifying project config (like `tsconfig.json`) without your explicit request - this often ends badly
- "Let me try a simpler approach" - often at the expense of correctness or understanding
- "**FOUND IT!**" - Claude probably didn't find it
- "Now I need to update the other two components that also use..." - keep it DRY
- High "Actually" count - Claude is spinning. After ~22 "Actually..." statements, I once got: "Actually, you know what, let me try the simplest possible thing: just don't render a footer at all for now. Keep the keyboard shortcuts working, but don't show the persistent footer UI. This eliminates the problem entirely." 🤠

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Active Claude Code sessions (reads from `~/.claude/projects`)

Made with Claude Code. No code was hand-crafted in the making of this package.
